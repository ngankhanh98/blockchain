## 📦 Installation
To run the web on your localhost, you will need [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) npm package:
```bash
# Install http-server package 
$ npm i http-server
```
#### Source code
From your command line (you're supposed to have [git](https://git-scm.com/) already installed in your environment)
```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/ngankhanh98/blockchain.git
$ cd blockchain

# Run in localhost
$ http--server --proxy
```
A website should be lauched at your `http://localhost:8080/`
